Other mechanics:
-When /capture or /cap is used within a team area, a timer is set and is decreased or increased based on how many players from each team are in the area.
-If a player is killed inside a team area by another player not of the same team, the player is sent back to spawn.
-Teams receive score points every 30 minutes for each area they capture, team areas cannot be captured if a team is offline, nor do they receive points of the areas they own.
-Players receive 1 diamond per captured area every 30 mintues if they are online.
